- All non-staff UNF access cards have been deactivated.

- Maximum number of people are allowed at UNF while a participant: 1 MRI operator, 2 research personnel, and 1 participant (parent can accompany child).
- All non-essential items should be left in offices before coming to UNF.
- Participants have access to a locker to store personal items.
- Only one team, and one participant at a time in UNF.
- Dedicated seating area set up outside of UNF.
- A team can only enter UNF at the time of their booked scan.
- Disinfect their hands, put on a procedural mask when you enter UNF.
- Entry can be denied if rules are not followed and/ or any indication or COVID-19 symptoms.

## Temporary cancellation rules

- If a scan needs to be cancelled due to COVID-19 related causes UNF will, temporarily,  waive its regular cancellation fee.

## Personal Protective Equipment
- Masks, gloves, disposable visors and hand sanitizer are available throughout UNF.

## Paperless paperwork
- Requisitions and MRI safety questionnaire done online.
- Both documents need to be filled out at least 24h prior to booked scan.
- Signature for MRI safety questionnaire collected by MRI operator on tablet.
- Bring original consent form to UNF, MRI operator will take a picture of the signature page as proof of consent.
- All electronic documentation and signatures are stored on UNF servers located at CRIUGM.

## Disinfection procedure
- After each participant, UNF will block off 30 minutes to disinfect the scanning room, control room, waiting room, locker, change room, and all high touch surfaces.
- Researchers are expected to help in the disinfection procedure by disinfecting their area in the control room (i.e. countertops, chair, keyboards, mice, etc...), equipment used in the MRI room (i.e. biopac lead, button box, etc…), and waiting area (chairs & tables). Staff will disinfect the head coil, bore, their area in the control room, and high touch surfaces.
- Virucidal disinfectants are available throughout UNF. Inside the MRI room both Pre-emp wipes (effective within 3 minutes) and 70%  isopropyl alcohol  (effective in 1 minute) in spray bottles is used, outside the MRI room 80% isopropyl alcohol wipes (effective in 1 minute) and 70%  isopropyl alcohol in spray bottles are available for use.  
- For a detailed cleaning procedure see document entitles: xxx

## Air circulation and purification
- UNF has its own Heat, Air Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) system that is separate from the rest of the IUGM
- Upgraded the filter used in our HVAC system so they can capture smaller particles (MERV11 to MERV13).
- Air recirculation allows for complete change of air in the unit once every hour.
- HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) grade air purifiers in testing room, control room and waiting room.

## COVID-19 safety signs
- Signs reminding user and staff to adhere to covid-19 safety measure have been place through out UNF

## Minimization of shared equipment
- Staff each have their own tablets and pens, as well as their own Siemens keyboard and mice
- All common computers in the control room have washable keyboards and mouse to allow for proper disinfection
- Furniture has been minimized to only the essential and cloth furniture replaced with plastic or vinyl.

## Closure of Mock scanning room
- Mock scanning room has been temporarily closed.

## Testing room (R0743)
- UNF testing room is open.
- Researchers who use the room are responsible for disinfection before and after
- A computer with E-prime and washable keyboard and mouse is in the room
- Disposable masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes (80% isopropyl alcohol wipes) are also available in the room.

## Staff shifts
- MRI operators will only scan in shifts
When not scanning, MRI operators will remain in their offices with doors closed

## Evaluation by the PCI and the PAPTC
- In August 2020, UNF underwent an inspection by a CIUSSS Advisor from “ soins infirmiers - Prévention et contrôle des infections (PCI)” as well as an “ agent d'amélioration Équipe Performance, amélioration des processus et trajectoire clientèle (PAPTC)” and they both approved UNF’s  COVID-19 safety measures and readiness to re-open to the community.
