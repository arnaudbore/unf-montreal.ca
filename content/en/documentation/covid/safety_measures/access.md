- In order to ensure control over who accesses UNF,  temporarily, all non-staff UNF access cards have been deactivated.
- In order to ensure everyone can follow the distancing measures, a maximum number of people are allowed at UNF while a participant is the scanner: 1 MRI operator, 2 research personnel, and 1 participant. An exception will be made when scanning children, when a parent will be allowed in the waiting room.
- No visitors will be allowed at UNF while a participant is being scanned.
- Researchers are encouraged to leave all non-essential items in their offices before coming to UNF.
- Bins will be made available to researchers and participants to put their personal items while at UNF. Participants will also have access to a locker to store personal items.
- Only one team at a time will be allowed access to UNF. A seating area has been set up outside of UNF for teams waiting to enter UNF. A team will only be allowed access to UNF at the time of their booked scan, and only if the previous team has left UNF, and the disinfection procedure is complete (see below section on disinfection).
- We will no longer be able to accommodate teams that run late.
- Upon entering, researchers and participants will need to disinfect their hands, switch their masks to a procedural mask (provided).
- Staff will ask participants questions about the presence of any COVID-19 symptoms (in general), and temperature may be taken using a non-contact thermometer. Participants might be denied entry to UNF if they confirm having a symptom of COVID-19, or, in the case that body temperature was taken, if they have signs of fever (i.e temperature higher than 37.7C).
- Research personnel is expected to follow rules outlined by CRIUGM and not show up at the CRIUGM if they have any symptoms of COVID-19. Entry to UNF can be denied if UNF staff feel like research personnel is not following CRIUGM rules.
- If a scan needs to be cancelled due to COVID-19 related causes UNF will, temporarily,  waive its regular cancellation fee.
