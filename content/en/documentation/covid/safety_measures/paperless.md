- UNF neuroinformatics staff have put in place a new system to minimize the amount of paper handled at UNF.
- Scans are booked like before, only now, requisitions form and MRI screening forms will be filled out online, via limesurvey.
- Both the requisition and MRI screening forms need to be completed at least 24h before your scan, failure to do so might result in delays getting started, which could mean teams will not have time to finish their scans.
- On the day of scanning, the MRI operator will go over the screening form with the participant, and collect their signatures on their tablets.
- Additionally, on the day of scanning research personnel will need to bring the signed consent form to UNF, and UNF staff will take a picture of the consent form as proof of consent.  
- Information collected on limesurvey is stored locally on UNF servers, and signatures and pictures collected on tablets are transferred every night to UNF servers.
